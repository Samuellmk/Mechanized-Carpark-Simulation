Following the Changi mechanised carpark
195 parking lots

Algorithm:
[âœ“] 1. Nearest First - cars are stored nearest to the lift
[ ] 2. Cached Nearest First - first level is used for quick storing of vehicles 
(Potential shuttle bottleneck when caching), sort to other levels when lifts are not busy
[ ] 3. Randomized spot - randomized car into slots of different levels
[ ] 4. Balance levels - levels are balanced based on capacity of each level (Highest level takes the longest)
